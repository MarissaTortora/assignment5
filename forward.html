        <p class="box"> Dustin Pedroia spent nearly a year on the injured list last year with a knee injury. Although not a player in the 2018 world series he was a key member of the team. Pedroia recently told WSPA-TV "I'm pretty confident that I'm going to be back for good and its going to be fun," The Sox have missed their second basemen, and hope that after a tough start to the season he can help turn it around. </p>
